Building XDM
============

This project uses ant as the build system. In Ubuntu,
you can install ant by typing:
     
     sudo apt install ant

Once installed, build the source by typing

     ant jar

Build output will be located in build/jar, which you can
run using:
     
     cd build/jar
     java -jar XDM.jar
