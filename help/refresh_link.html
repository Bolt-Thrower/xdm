<h1><font color="brown">Refreshing Broken/Dead Downloads</font></h1>
<p>While resuming downloads sometimes you may encounter an error
'download session has been expired'.<br>
This error occures when the download link is valid only for a limited
amount of time.<br>
<br>
To resume such downloads you will need to find a new download link that
points to that same file which was being downloaded.</p>
<br>
Follow the bellow steps to get a fresh link:
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Goto XDM Menu->Refresh Link.<br>
	It will open the Refresh Link dialog.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If XDM knows the webpage from which the download was captured it
	will be displayed, otherwise you will have to find that webpage
	manually.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Open that webpage and find the download link which points to the
	same file which was being downloaded (e.g. file size is same).<br>
	<b>If it is a video, Open the web page that contains the video and
	play it again, then select the link from XDM Media Grabber.<br>
	If it was a YouTube video, captured by XDM YouTube Downloader, then
	repete the steps you performed last time to get the direct download
	link.</b></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Paste the new link in textbox and click OK.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Resume the download.</p>
	</li>
</ul>


<p>NOTE: If the new download link does not points to the same file
which was being downloaded (filesize is not same) then XDM will throw an
error or will result to a corrupted download.</p>
